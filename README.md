## A 3D Garden for Your Digital Memories

MemoryScape is a full-stack application that transforms your digital memories (photos and videos) into a beautiful, interactive 3D garden. The project allows users to bring their memories to life, giving them a tangible and emotionally engaging way to revisit their past.

Every memory is represented as a unique flower in a serene, 3D environment. Users can navigate this garden and interact with the flowers to reveal a holographic display of the memoryâ€”a photo or video from that moment in time.

## Key Features

  * **Interactive 3D Environment:** An immersive and responsive 3D garden where memories are visualized as flowers.
  * **Holographic Memory Display:** Clicking on a flower reveals a floating holographic screen to display the associated photo or video.
  * **User-Friendly Dashboard:** A simple admin interface for creating, managing, and organizing your memories.
  * **Scalable Backend:** A robust API to handle memory data and serve content to the frontend.

## Under the Hood

The application is built using a modern and powerful technology stack.

**Frontend:**

  * **React:** For a component-based and efficient user interface.
  * **Three.js / React-Three-Fiber:** To render and manage the immersive 3D scene.

**Backend:**

  * **FastAPI:** A high-performance Python web framework for a fast and reliable API.

**Database:**

  * **SQLite:** A lightweight, serverless database for persistent data storage.
